Drop-in module, simply install in addons\darkrpmodification-master\lua\darkrp_modules folder. Configured via the convars darkrp_dropmoney_enable and darkrp_dropmoney_percentage.

Credit for the inital code goes to Chisler on facepunch forums, I fixed it up and added proper convars. If Chisler isn't ok with the code being posted here please let me know.
